    description='With the rise of machine learning models in sensitive areas, such as sexism detection on social media platforms, the accuracy of these models is paramount. Not only should the model make accurate predictions, but its explanations for those predictions should also be justifiable. Human annotators play a critical role in validating these models. Therefore, assessing the reliability of these annotators becomes crucial to ensure the quality of the validation process.',
